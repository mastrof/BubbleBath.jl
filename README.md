Generate loose packings of spheres in orthorhombic domains, in 2 and 3 dimensions.

## Features
* Fill a domain with spheres from a given distribution of radii to reach a target
    packing fraction, or from already-sampled radii.
* Control minimum allowed distance between spheres.
* Decide whether spheres can cross through domain boundaries or not.
